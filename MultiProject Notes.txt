wap using Django to have multiple Applications.


Disadvantage:
-------------

Assume we have 100 Applications
In each application 3 views.

HENCE 300 VIEWS CONFIGURATION HAS TO BE DONE IN URLS.PY(PROJECT LEVEL).

In order over come the above create urls.py at Application and perform the configuration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)if the url pattern is set at the Application level the readablity of the code increases.
2)Maintenance of code will become simple.

Whenever urlpattern is set at Application level, the below configuration has to be performed in urls.py of
project level.
1)import the include()
	from django.urls import path,include

2)Add a url pattern
	path('blog/',include('blog.urls'))
