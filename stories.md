## News Website using Django

Django is a high-level framework which is super fast, fully loaded with extra packages, versatile, secure and scalable. In this project, I have created a News Website and used News API and fetch all the headline news from the api.

My app had cover these stories –

*   A website which collates data on various hot topics from around the world. And provides news from India, Worldwide, Science & Technology, Sports etc.
*   It also features a statistic board displaying COVID19 cases on the homepage.
* Homepage is the replica of the Google Chrome.
* For corona count, Beautiful Soup library is used. From the [this website] (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread/) live count is taken and displaying it on the homepage.
