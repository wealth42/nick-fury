In this Project I developed a webiste on beautiful places to visit using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap as a framework.

I have created only a part of website due to time constraints. You can see how it will
be under Asia Tab in The Project. In the same way with slight modifications the other
tabs will be. As mentioned ude to time constraints the remaining tabs will direct to 
some articles for tourism for the respective places mentioned.
