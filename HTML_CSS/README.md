*Note: This is a public submission. Any work on this assignment does not bring Wealth42 or its employees any moat; and by design, is made to assess skills we need. Stories provided are unrelated to Wealth42's core business.* 

### Assignment

*   You can select any one of the stories mentioned in the [stories](../stories/) folder, and develop a HTML website using CSS for it. 
*   Follow [Instructions](#instructions) and [Submission Process](#submission-process) to complete the assignment.
*   For success, ensure you get as many checks as in our [Assessment Criteria](#assessment-criteria)
*   We typically take 5 days to evaluate this submission.

### Instructions
*   HTML & CSS: 
    *   Design 4 main pages, along with a placeholder page to which you can link the rest of the website (with an under construction sign)
    *   Design and organise your webpage to depict the frontend and objectives of the story selected.
    *   Integrate CSS to add styling and animations to the webpage.
    *   Use of Frameworks is encouraged, however, you must also	 display excellence in pure CSS as well.
*   View: 
    *   Adding animations and transitions to the webpage.
    *   Showcasing media queries and breakpoints to design responsive behaviour.
    *   Include any collateral/stock images (make sure these are okay for public use)
    *   Include icons/vector art wherever relevant.
*   Functionality(optional): 
    *   Use JavaScript to add functionality to the website. However, no backend integrations, only static designs are required.
    *   Make sure the webpages are responsive on all the devices viewed on.
 
### Assessment Criteria
1. Meeting ALL criteria (which are not explicitly marked as optional) in the [Instructions](#instructions)
2. Maintainability and organisation of code 
3. Usage of HTML, CSS or any Framework. (Mention the Framework in the README.md)
4. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges. If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments.  
5. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product. For a HTML/CSS dev, this could translate to: 
    1. Making smooth animations between different transitions.
    2. Using flexbox and grid techniques separately to show mastery in both.
6. No submissions to be made with compressed/binary files - all source code should be version controlled and visible in plain text in github.
7. How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project.
8. Follow [best practices](https://github.community/t/best-practices-for-pull-requests/10195) for pull requests.
9. [Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/turbo/efb8d57c145e00dc38907f9526b60f17) for clean commit messages.
10. Ability to learn and use version control via Git
