### Assessment Criteria
1. Maintainability and organisation of code 
2. Usage of
    1. HTML, CSS or any Framework.(Mention the Framework in the README.md)
3. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges.
If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments.  
4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product.
For a HTML/CSS dev, this could translate to: 
    1. Making smooth animations between different transitions.
    2. Using flexbox and grid techniques separately to show mastery in both.
5. How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project
6. [Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/turbo/efb8d57c145e00dc38907f9526b60f17) for clean commit messages

### Submission Process
1. Clone this repository
2. Remove the assignment README’s (and all folders) and start developing your project in it
3. Add a readme that details on exactly how to run the code
4. If you are submitting a project of your choice, follow these steps –
    *   Attach the story of your project in a file named stories.md at root location. For reference, do checkout [stories](../stories/)
        >   *Since the project is something we'll need to understand purpose of before evaluating, this file should clearly explain the purpose of the application you are publishing.*
5. Raise a Pull Request

### Code of Ethics
*   Please be original, all your submissions are public via GitHub.
*   Assignments given by us, are being publicly submitted. Hence, it does not create any moat for Wealth42, and is mostly distant from our core business purpose.
