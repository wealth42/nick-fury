             to avoid re-flaring the infection rates of the virus. Wherever possible, users who currently use public transport should
             be able to switch to alternate commute (like rental bikes). Specifically for the residents of London, you
             can utilize a feed provided by Transport For London, available [here](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs).

### Assessment Criteria
1. Maintainability and organisation of code
2. Correctly choosing normalisation or denormalisation where applicable 
3. Balancing between speed and quality of code - we understand that candidates can only spend limited time on these challenges.
If you do make any trade-offs in favour of saving time, do mention them in comments.  
4. Ownership - going beyond the exact job description to deliver a finished product.
For a Python/Data Engineer dev, this could potentially translate to: 
    1. Ensuring safety of API keys (if any are used)
    2. Creating a query utility that lets a user query the number of free bikes currently available by giving a subset of the 'commonName' string
5. How much the candidate stays in touch with us during the process of the project
6. [Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/turbo/efb8d57c145e00dc38907f9526b60f17) for clean commit messages

### Submission Process
1. Clone this repository
2. Remove the assignment README’s (and all folders) and start developing your project in it
3. Add a readme that details on exactly how to run the code
4. Raise a Pull Request
